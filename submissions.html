            <h2>Call for Proceedings</h2>
            We are soliciting high-quality papers that will go through rigorous
            peer-review. Accepted papers will be presented at HiTSeq as either
            posters or talks, and will be published in a special proceedings
            section of the Bioinformatics journal. Papers requiring extensive
            revisions will be considered separately as regular papers for the
            Bioinformatics or Bioinformatics Advances journals and as abstracts
            for HiTSeq. All manuscripts should be submitted via the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismb2024">ISMB
              2024</a> Proceedings submission system. During submission please
            select the general subject of your submissions, and then make sure
            to <strong>specify</strong> <strong>HiTSeq</strong> as the COSI of
            your submission, to ensure your manuscript is assigned to our track.
            Please follow the submissions guidelines and process as for the rest
            of the ISMB Proceedings Submissions. </div>

            <p><span style="color: red;">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, HiTSeq                2020 is going virtual  with the rest of <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismb2020">ISMB                  2020</a>! We will use a remote presentation platform for the                keynotes and talks selected from both proceedings and abstracts                with virtual session chair moderation and Q&amp;A. We will also                have a system ready for poster presentations with pre-recorded                short presentation videos. We strongly encourage everyone to                submit abstracts for talk and poster selections. Please keep                following our <a href="https://twitter.com/HiTSeq">Twitter                  account</a> for more announcements.</span></p> -->

            <p> We are soliciting high-quality <b>unpublished</b> abstracts.
              Accepted abstracts will be presented at HiTSeq as either posters
              or talks. All abstracts should be submitted via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ismbe024abstract">ISMB
                2024 Abstracts submission system</a>. <b>Please make sure to
                select HiTSeq as track </b>to ensure your manuscript is
              assigned to our track. Please submit your abstracts as 1-2 page
              PDF files, with font size 11, and <i>reasonable</i> margins. </p>
            <p><br />
            </p>
            <p> You can submit either: <br />

            <ul>
              <li> Unpublished work: Short talk and/or poster abstracts. 1-2
                page PDF, with font size 11, and <i>reasonable</i> margins.</li>
              <li> Published work for the Highlights Track: Full published paper
                with a cover letter stating why your work should be highlighted
                at HiTSeq. </li>

            </ul>
            <p> HiTSeq late abstracts will be evaluated for selection as posters
              only. The abstracts should target topics of immediate relevance in
              the field. To be considered for an oral presentation the material
              should not have been previously published in any journal or
              proceedings. </p>
            Abstracts should be divided in "Background", "Results", and
            "Conclusions" sections, and can extend to up to 2 pages in order to
            permit proper review and assignment to poster or talks. Unless the
            authors specify that the submission is for poster presentation only,
            all abstracts will be considered for oral presentations as well. The
            final decisions whether each paper or abstract is presented as a
            talk or a poster will be made and communicated to authors as per the
            conference schedule. Authors of abstracts selected for oral
            presentations should confirm their intent to attend the conference
            and present their work promptly, else their slot will be allocated
            to other abstract. All proceedings paper submissions will be
            automatically considered for abstracts irrespective of the outcome
            of the full paper review.<br />
